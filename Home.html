        I'm a simple person that can do simple things, just like any other
        person I heve goals and dreams I wish to accomplish oneday. My fathers
        name is Dax Carranza and my Mothers name is Ning Carranza, they are now
        separated, I'm part of a broken family. I also have a sister her name is
        Nicole Ivy Carranza.I was born and raised in Ilagan, Isabela. That's
        where I completed my pre-school 2nd grade elementary years. We moved to
        Laguna at 2009, at that time I was still living with my grandparents so
        my aunts and uncles decided we move here because my grandparents were
        getting old. The 1st school I ever went to here was Nagcarlan Montesory
        Center I only went there for a year. From grades 4-6 I studied at Rizal
        Standard Academy. Highschool for me was a rollercoaster there where good
        and terrible times. I finished my whole 4 years of highscool at St.
        Marys Academy of Nagcarlan, based from the name you it's obvious that it
        was a catholic school so it was much more stricter than regular schools.
        I failed to mention that my grandparents are not catholic. They're
        Iglesia Ni Cristo members. Since I lived with them, I also grew up to be
        and Iglecia Ni Cristo member. Back to when I was still going to SMAN.
        Being and INC had it's benefits, I didn't have to participate in Sunday
        masses where they recorded our attendance and some traditions that
        catholic schools had I was free of. But as I grew older my point of view
        in religion changed. As of now I am a Deist, I don't believe in
        religion, but I do believe in a Supreme Being. I was one of the few who
        first witnessed a major change in the edicational system in the
        Philippines. I was one of the first K-12 students, I spent my Senior
        Highschool days at STI San Pablo, and those were the best years of my
        life, a rollercoaster unlike anyother, plus that is where I met my
        Girlfriend, Maria Erika N. Lauta. Fast forward in time to the present. I
        know study at Laguna State Polytechnic University in San Pablo Laguna. I
        am a 3rd Year College Student and currently taking Bachelor of Science
        Information Technology majoring in Web and Mobile Application
        Development. My life is yet to end I still have centuries ahead of me I
        hope that I spend the rest of them happy and live my life with no
        regret.
